			<p>We've all been there at that spot where we really really wish for a restroom but it only happens then that we can't seem to find one. Be it the fanciest marketplace or the gloomiest bus stop, there seem to be no washroom around. Our website, filters out the nearest washroom and reviews for you the cleanest one. The project is not meagrely a toilet-finder. Women have different sanitation needs from men, and hence their hygiene requirements are also different. Through our website, we will provide the cleanest restrooms available which are equipped with the most basic necessity of sanitary pads. 
                Similarly, mothers with newborn children also find it difficult to breastfeed in public. Through our website, we shall tackle this taboo issue as well.</p>
